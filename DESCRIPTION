Description: This is a small collection of the most useful functions I wrote during my master project. The package consists of functions that are necessary for the bioinformatics pipeline that I used to analyze Illumina HM450 and EPIC data. The package also includes other useful functions that can be helpful when analyzing DNA methylation data from these platforms.
